# from-and-into-csv
Takes address from csv file and adds latitude and longitude into new csv file
You need geopy before you can run it. Simply pip install geopy in cmd and you should be good.
Put the csv file into same directory, open the .py file and edit the csvFileName into your file.
Edit the rows to get correct information into input.
Run the program. It creates a new file into the same directory with correct info.

The csv it's written for is in certain format with addresses seperated and that's why I am adding different coloums together. It makes the cordinates much more accurate.

Hope you find some use for it
